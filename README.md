# Maze
This program reads from file a maze which (an example) looks like:

  10 12
  ...###.#.... 
  ##.#...####.
  ...#.#.#....
  #.####.####.
  #F..#..#.##.
  ###.#....#S.
  #.#.####.##.
  ....#.#...#.
  .####.#.#.#.
  ........#...
  
where the numbers represent the number of rows and columns respectively. A breadth-first search technique is used in order
to find the shortest path from start to finish (#'s represent a wall) or if no path exists. 

NOTE: PDF provides instructions, header file not included for simplicity.
